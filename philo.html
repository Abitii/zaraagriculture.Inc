                Investment Philosophy

                Our fundamental investment philosophy is to build diversified agricultural investment portfolios customized to meet specific client needs.
                
                ZAI Co.Ltdâ€™s investment philosophy reflects our belief that to optimize performance, farmland investments are best identified and managed through the integration of engineers, hydrogeologists and pedologists.
                
                Once ZAI Co.Ltd investment professionals develop model portfolios and farm targets based on client objectives, we source properties by utilizing our property-level farmland development expertise and strategic relationships. Our investment strategy is based on research and investment fundamentals. Clients can benefit from our successful integration of hands-on property-level farming knowledge and quantitative management skills. 
                 
                We follow a top-down, bottom-up investment strategy, in a five-step process:
                1
